# pandas-challenge-1
## UNC AI Bootcamp - Module 4 Homework

### Background
In the `pandas-challenge-1` project, we dive into the world of data analysis using Python's Pandas library. This project is part of the UNC AI Bootcamp curriculum, designed to provide hands-on experience in practical data analysis. Our focus is on a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company, where we explore, clean, process, and extract valuable insights to answer real-world business questions. The challenge encompasses tasks like identifying top customers, determining popular product categories, calculating profits, and more. By the end of this project, you'll gain essential skills in data manipulation and analysis, preparing you for complex data challenges in your future career.

### Files
- **Module 4 Challenge Files**: Download the necessary files [here](#https://github.com/Katadhin/pandas-challenge-1/blob/main/client_dataset.csv).

### Getting Started
Before diving into the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Create and clone a new repository named `pandas-challenge-1`.
2. Add the starter files from the downloaded challenge files.
3. Push the initial changes to GitHub or GitLab.

### Challenge Instructions

#### Part 1: Explore the Data
- **Tasks**:
  - Import data from the CSV file.
  - View column names and gather basic statistics using the `describe()` function.
  - Identify the top three item categories and subcategories.
  - Determine the top five clients based on entry frequency.

#### Part 2: Transform the Data
- **Tasks**:
  - Calculate subtotals, shipping prices, and total prices with sales tax.
  - Determine the cost and profit of each line item.

#### Part 3: Confirm Your Work
- **Objective**: Validate the calculated total prices against provided order receipts for three specific orders.

#### Part 4: Summarize and Analyze
- **Objective**: Analyze spending patterns of the top 5 clients, create a summary DataFrame, and write a brief summary of the findings.

### Methodology
Our approach to data analysis involves initial data exploration to understand the dataset's structure and contents. Following this, we transform the data to derive meaningful metrics such as profits and costs. Finally, we confirm the accuracy of our transformations and summarize our findings to draw conclusions and answer the business questions posed.

### Insights and Findings
- A summary of key insights and trends observed in the data.
- Notable observations regarding customer behavior, sales patterns, and profitability.

### Challenges and Learnings
Throughout this project, we encountered several challenges, particularly in data transformation and interpretation. Overcoming these hurdles enhanced our problem-solving skills and deepened our understanding of data analysis methodologies.

### Future Enhancements
Potential future work includes:
- Deeper analysis into customer segmentation.
- Time series analysis for trend and seasonality detection.
- Predictive modeling to forecast sales and customer behavior.
